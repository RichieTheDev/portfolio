        About Me
      </h1>
      <p className="text-lg p-2 sm:p-4 mt-2 sm:mt-5">
        I'm a highly skilled Front End Developer with 4+ years of turning ideas
        to reality. With my extensive experience in React JS, JavaScript,
        TypeScript, and Next.js, I have successfully contributed to various
        remote projects, showcasing my ability to collaborate effectively and
        follow Agile methodologies. My expertise includes implementing
        TypeScript's module system, decorators, and generics to enhance code
        maintainability and scalability. I have a strong background in
        optimizing query response time and system efficiency with PostgreSQL, as
        well as integrating Tailwind CSS for efficient styling and responsive UI
        design. My proficiency in tools such as Cypress, Jest, Zustand, and Git,
        combined with my knowledge of API consumption and CI/CD, has allowed me
        to deliver high-quality code with improved testing coverage and reduced
        deployment errors. My contributions to previous companies include
        successful integration of Firebase authentication and real-time
        database, efficient data management using Sanity.io and Supabase, and
        accelerated development cycles with Zustand and React Router. With a
        passion for delivering exceptional user experiences, I have demonstrated
        my ability to improve page load times, search engine discoverability,
        and front-end performance through Next.js Server-Side Rendering and
        RESTful API consumption.
